# Arduino-Port-Discovery
Discovers and assigns port location for the raspberry pi.
This assumes you are only using 1 arduino. It will igore any addtional arduino plugged in.

Currently Supports:
 Arduino Mega
 Arduino Uno
 Arduino Leonardo 
 Sparkfun Redboard
 FTDI Cables
 FTDI USB Chips (SparkFun FTDI Basic)

More will come as I get my hands on them.

Easy to add into any preexisting code and easy to expand for more boards.

Needs to have pySerial installed:
  python -m pip install pyserial
