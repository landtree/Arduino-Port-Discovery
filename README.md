# Arduino-Port-Discovery
Discovers and assigns port location for the raspberry pi.
Currently Supports:
  Arduino Mega
  Arduino Uno
  Arduino Leonardo 
  Sparkfun Redboard

More will come as I get my hands on them.

Easy to add into any preexisting code and easy to expand for more boards.

Needs to have pySerial installed:
  python -m pip install pyserial
